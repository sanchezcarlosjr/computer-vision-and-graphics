      "text": "# Introduction to the JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks\nThis is a short introduction to two of the flagship tools created by\n[the Jupyter Community](https://jupyter.org).\n\n> **Note**: This interface is provided by the\n> [JupyterLite project](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which embeds an\n> entire JupyterLab interface, with many popular packages for scientific computing, in\n> your browser. There may be some minor differences in behavior between JupyterLite and\n> the JupyterLab you install locally.\n\n## JupyterLab üß™\n\n**JupyterLab** is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It\nenables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text\neditors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible\nmanner. It is the interface that you're looking at right now.\n\n**For an overview of the JupyterLab interface**, see the **JupyterLab Welcome Tour** on\nthis page, by going to `Help -> Welcome Tour` and following the prompts.\n\n> **See Also**: For a more in-depth tour of JupyterLab with a full environment that runs\n> in the cloud, see\n> [the JupyterLab introduction on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/demo).\n\n## Jupyter Notebooks üìì\n\n**Jupyter Notebooks** are a community standard for communicating and performing\ninteractive computing. They are a document that blends computations, outputs,\nexplanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.\n\nJupyterLab is one interface used to create and interact with Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n**For an overview of Jupyter Notebooks**, see the **JupyterLab Welcome Tour** on this\npage, by going to `Help -> Notebook Tour` and following the prompts.\n\n> **See Also**: For a more in-depth tour of Jupyter Notebooks and the Classic Jupyter\n> Notebook interface, see\n> [the Jupyter Notebook IPython tutorial on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/HEAD?urlpath=tree/binder/Index.ipynb).\n\n## An example: visualizing data in the notebook ‚ú®\n\nBelow is an example of a code cell. We'll visualize some simple data using two popular\npackages in Python. We'll use [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) to create some random data,\nand [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) to visualize it.\n\nNote how the code and the results of running the code are bundled together."

Each of the items below corresponds to a file or folder\nin the **file browser to the left**.\n\n- [python.ipynb](python.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook that shows off some basic Python\n  functionality, including more visualizations, data structures, and scientific\n  computing libraries.\n- `pyodide/` is a folder that contains several Jupyter Notebooks that highlight many\n  more things that you can do in JupyterLab / JupyterLite. Explore them for inspiration\n  about what you'd like to do next.\n- [p5.ipynb](p5.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook that shows off computing with\n  [the p5 platform](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/), which allows you to build\n  visual experiences with Javascript.\n- [javascript.ipynb](javascript.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook that shows off how you can\n  run Javascript code within an ipynb file."
